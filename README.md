# D minor

D minor is a random name from my roommate's English book. This project
mainly serves as my personal calculator for some mathematical uses.
Currently it includes a few easy and poor-implemented tools such as
rational number, matrix, polynomial, interpolation and recently (Mar
2018), a linear programming tool.

I know I'm new to computer programming and my code sucks, but anyway it's
getting better little by little. This project is still under developing
and (I hope) a lot of new features will be added to it in the future.
